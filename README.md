# ðŸŒŒ Ad-Astra Dark

Ad Astra's space-inspired design not only helps you focus on your work and increase productivity but adds a touch of personality and style to your workspace.

The carefully selected contrasting blue and lavender colors improve readability and make your code stand out, while the darker background reduces eye strain and fatigue during long coding sessions.

## Hide Indent Guides

If you prefer not to see indent guides, you can hide them by adding the following to your VS Code `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "editorIndentGuide.activeBackground1": "#292928",
}
```

This will make the indent guides invisible, regardless of the theme's default settings.
